Input data format

Your program is to read from standard input. The input starts with a line containing an
integer n (1 < n < 100) , where n is the number of test cases. In the following n lines,
each contains two strings. Note that two strings are separated by tab(\t) not space. That is,
strings can contain the space.

Output data format

Your program is to write to standard output (stdout). Print exactly one line which contains
the n distances that are separated by space.
